Machine Learning Regression algorithm

In this Dataset, we have Historical Data of different cause of deaths for all ages around the World. The key features of this Dataset are:

1) Country/Territory
2) Code
3) Year
4) Nutritional Deficiencies
5) Malaria
6) Interpersonal Violence
7) Cardiovascular Diseases
8) Tuberculosis
9) HIV/AIDS
10) Self-harm
11) Environmental Heat and Cold Exposure
12) Conflict and Terrorism
13) Diabetes
14) Poisonings
15) Road Injuries

There are around 31 reasons of death. For analysis porpuses we are using 4 diseaseas i.e (Nutritional Deficiencies, Malaria, Interpersonal Violence, Cardiovascular Diseases).

You can do analysis on all data but pairplot and heatmap will take time to generate. 

Note - Pairplot and heatmap dont work on strings.

Topics 
1) Dataframes
2) Descriptive statistics
3) Exploratory Data Analysis
4) Pairplot
5) Heatmap
6) Training a Linear Regression Model
7) Year vs Total no. of Deaths for Canada
8) Year vs Total no. of Deaths for India
9) Creating and Training the Model
10) Predictions from our Model
